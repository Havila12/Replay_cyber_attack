# Replay_cyber_attack
A replay attack is a kind of man-in-the-middle attack in which an attacker sniffs messages being sent on a channel to intercept them and resend them under the cloak of authentic messages. What makes the replay attack particularly harmful is that the attacker does not even need to decrypt the message they resend but can still fool the receiver into thinking that the received message is legitimate. A replay attack is 'passive' in nature (no active manipulation of data in transit) and it is 'online' meaning it occurs when the attacker captures the data is enroute to the authentication server.
